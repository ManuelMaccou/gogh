Just got it professionally cleaned a few weeks ago including Scotchgard which makes it even more stain resistant. Completely modular so pieces can be added, removed, or rearranged as necessary. Comfortably fits 4 people but can squeeze in a couple more for movie nights. The back cushions can also be flipped for a non-tufted look. Also comes with an extra seat cushion if you want to remove the chaise (or if one gets damaged). Pickup in elevator building in SoHo preferred (easy to move since itâ€™s modular) but delivery can be arranged for a fee.";
